    <<~RULES
      The Towers of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of 
      three rods and three disks of different sizes which can slide onto any 
      rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a stack of descending sizes 
      on the leftmost rod.

      Move the entire stack to the rightmost rod under these rules:

        1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
        2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks 
           and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved 
           if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
        3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
